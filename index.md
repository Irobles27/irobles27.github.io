# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Ivan Robles Jarquin and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton and my major is 

Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 7 part-2

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to code a program that told me what times were available to park your car. I could make a function that would tell me if parking was aviable with simply the street name and time of day.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was a favorite because I always wanted to learn some basic code on linux program. I was able to use all the knowledge learned in my lecture class to make a simple program that would output whatever I wanted.
