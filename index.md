# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Ivan Robles Jarquin and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton and my major is 

Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 7 part-2

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to code a program that told me what times were available to park your car. I could make a function that would tell me if parking was aviable with simply the street name and time of day. This was both fun and a learning process, and was for sure one of the more complicated labs;.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was a favorite because I always wanted to learn some basic code on linux program. I was able to use all the knowledge learned in my lecture class to make a simple program that would output a simple text "Hello World". It was a good way to get to know the type of code and concepts we will use for the lab class.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, was a favorite because I always wondered about all the code needed to make an animation. This lab gave me the chance to be able to make my very own gif and also learn more about RGB and how it works. I loved seeing the process of how to make gifs, and seeing how complex they are and how the RGB can change a lot.
